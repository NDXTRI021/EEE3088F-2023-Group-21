# EEE3088F-2023-Group-21
Project Repo for group 21 of EEE3088F (2023)

Instructions:
- Don't push to main if time sensitive. Push to your branch in case multiple people push at the same time.
- Try not to use zip files for push/pulls, they make it hard to figure out what's changed.
- Don't clutter main. Keep a good folder structure.
